					<h1 class="medium left-line">A tribute to our founder Robert Lane</h1>
					<img loading="lazy" class="robert-small"
						src="https://mondaycharity.org.uk/wp-content/themes/monday/imgs/robert-lane.jpg" />
					<p>Robert Lane was born in 1932 in London. His prep school in Chichester was evacuated to Cornwall
						during the war. He went to Sherborne School and afterwards did his two years’ National Service
						in the Royal Tank Regiment.</p>
					<div class="more-cont" style="display:none;">
						<p>Both sides of his family were involved in the transport and haulage business. His
							grandfather’s firm, J R Munday Limited, had major haulage contracts for London County
							Council. The family’s property company, Chelsea Estates Limited, owned land in Battersea
							which was, for most of the 20th century, a disregarded area of London. Robert’s grandfather
							bought the land now occupied by the Royal College of Art by Battersea Bridge. Robert joined
							the family business in the late 1950s and worked all his life to manage and enhance it. He
							became the sole owner on the death of his father, Harold Lane, in 1972.</p>
						<p>Over the years Robert enhanced the portfolio of properties that Chelsea Estates owned in the
							South of England. He oversaw the change from residential to commercial properties and
							started to carry out development of new sites. As a young man, Robert bought a small piece
							of land beside the railway bridge next to the Thames to park lorries. Robert could not have
							guessed at the time that, in 2012, this site would be sold by Chelsea Estates for £24
							million and become the site for a 33 storey block of desirable flats.</p>
						<p>Robert and his wife Elspeth were extraordinarily generous. When the time came for Robert to
							relinquish the burden of running Chelsea Estates in 2012, instead of extracting their value
							from the company, he and Elspeth decided to give their shareholdings to a charitable trust,
							also named the Monday Charitable Trust, which they had established a few years before. The
							charity has since become an incorporated charity, whose aim is to improve the life chances
							of people who suffer from disadvantages: homelessness, mental health problems, lack of
							education and poor social mobility.</p>
						<p>Robert was a kind, courteous and modest man, always careful in his business dealings. He
							never sought publicity for his generosity. Outside the business, as a young man he loved
							sailing and had a boat on the South Coast. He and Elspeth met while skiing in Switzerland
							and they also shared a love of racing. They visited Scotland regularly, enjoying cruises
							round the Scottish islands. They went to Cornwall each year and cream teas were a particular
							favourite of Robert’s.</p>

										<h2>Elspeth Lane</h2>

										<h6>Founder Trustee</h6>

										<p>
											Elspeth was born in Singapore and managed to leave before the fall of
											Singapore in February 1942. She was too young to remember the journey on the
											high seas back to Britain. Her father was a civilian prisoner in Singapore
											for three and a half years at that time.

											She was educated and lived in Scotland. Before meeting Robert, she had
											worked part time as a secretary and also part time as the village postman,
											providing cover during the various postmen’s holidays. She spent some of her
											time with her two horses winning the Small Hunter Class and the Working
											Hunter Class at the Royal Highland Show in Edinburgh and going to horse
											trials around the country. She met Robert in 1973, and they married in 1977.
											Elspeth moved South to farm on the Surrey/Hampshire border. She was very
											much involved in the running of the dairy herd, and the arable crops.
											Interests include ski-ing (in her younger days), travel and horse racing.

										<h2>Andy Hope</h2>

										<h6>Charity Consultant</h6>

										<p>Andy qualified as a chartered accountant in 2000, specialising in financial
											services with a particular focus on hedge funds (Bermuda) and hedge fund
											managers (London). Having spent nearly 10 years in the financial services
											sector, he moved on to work with not-for-profit organisations starting with
											The Children’s Investment Fund Foundation where he gained significant
											experience in working with a highly impactful grant funding organisation
											working with children globally in areas such as health and nutrition,
											education and welfare and climate change. </p>
										<p>To address his desire to gain experience in a more operational charity, Andy
											went on to become Jewish Care’s Finance Director (and latterly their Chief
											Operating Officer) - a social care organisation working with the elderly
											members of the Jewish community in London and the South East of England.
											During his 10 years there, amongst many other achievements, he oversaw the
											development of Jewish Care’s care campus in Stanmore, where a £48 million
											development was completed that comprised a care home, independent living
											complex and a community centre for the local community.</p>
										<p>Prior to becoming a chartered accountant, Andy completed a PhD in Molecular
											Marine Biology at Bristol University with his love of science being passed
											down to his four children.</p>
										<p>Andy is now providing consultancy services to a range of different charitable
											organisations applying the knowledge he has gained throughout his career,
											both in the investment and the not-for-profit worlds. He also manages the
											family’s 65-acre farm on North Yorkshire when he is not advising his charity
											clients.</p>

							<h2>Trust structure</h2>

							<p>MCT is a charitable company limited by guarantee, incorporated on 17 August 2017 (company
								registration number 10910936) and registered with the Charity Commissioners as a charity
								(charity registration number 1174232). MCT’s governing document is the Articles of
								Association dated 17 August 2017, as amended by Special Resolution dated 23 April 2019.
							</p>

							<p>The minimum number of trustees required by the Articles is three and the maximum is
								eight. Robert and Elspeth Lane, Jonathan Brinsden and Sarah Baxter were the four
								original trustees. They became Founder Trustees and serve an indefinite term based on
								their relative experience and contribution to MCT as a whole.</p>

							<p>New trustees are Elected Trustees and serve a term of three years. They are appointed by
								ordinary resolution and may serve a maximum of two terms. They may thereafter be
								reappointed annually if recommended by the chairman.</p>

						</div>

						<div id='tab-2' class="tab">



							<h2>Management committees</h2>

							<p>The Trustees have delegated certain responsibilities to three Committees.</p>

							<p>The Management and Operations (Ops) Committee reviews the financial and governance
								arrangements for the Charity. The Ops Committee is responsible for reporting to the
								Trustees on investment and property matters and directing the investment managers and
								property advisers as appropriate.</p>

							<p>The Social Investments Committee (the Tuesday Committee) reviews Social Investment
								opportunities, obtains advice on them as needed and then advises the Trustees on the
								level of investment and terms.</p>

							<p>The Investment Committee has responsibility in connection with the benchmarking of
								investment performance, adherence to the Charity’s investment policy and to support the
								development of the Charity’s overall investment strategy and aims regarding the
								Charity’s quoted and unquoted investments. </p>

						</div>

						<div id='tab-3' class="tab">

							<h2>Investment policy</h2>

							<p>In 2024, in a review of the Charity’s investment strategy and requirements, the Trustees
								considered various approaches to sustainable investment in the context of the Spectrum
								of Capital Model (below) and the FCA’s Sustainability Disclosure Requirements (SDR), as
								well as climate change. </p>
							<h4 style="margin-block: 2rem;">The Spectrum of Capital Model</h4>
							<style>
								.lightbox:hover {
									cursor: pointer;
								}
							</style>
							<a class="lightbox" data-fancybox data-src="Investment-profile.png"
								data-caption="Source: Bridges Impact + and the Impact Management Project">
								<img src="Investment-profile.png" />
							</a>
							<i>Source: Bridges Impact + and the Impact Management Project</i>
							<br /><br />

							<p>The Spectrum of Capital is a way of mapping the broad range of risk/return strategies in
								sustainable and social impact investing, from investing for maximum profit with no
								regard to impact through to philanthropic investment with potential loss of capital.
								This is overlaid with Impact Management’s ABC model: Avoid Harm / Benefit
								Stakeholders / Contribute to Solutions, which seeks to further classify investments
								focusing on their impact on people and the planet.  </p>
							<p>In addition to the spectrum of capital framework, some investment managers aim to align
								with the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to identify areas where they can
								engage with companies to encourage best practice, as well as areas where they can
								identify investment opportunities.</p>
							<p>Following a selection process undertaken by an independent consultancy firm, the Trustees
								appointed CCLA and Sarasin & Partners as their principal investment managers on a fully
								delegated basis. The Trustees have agreed an investment policy and have asked both CCLA
								and Sarasin & Partners to invest on a total return basis with income reinvested. A
								benchmark of CPI + 4% will be applied to the investment portfolio.</p>
							<p>In addition, the Trustees decided that up to 15% of the Charity’s net assets would be
								allocated to Social Investments and Impact Investments, both of which would be focused
								on the three thematic areas of the Charity - Housing, Education and Environmental
								Crises.</p>
							<br>
							<h4>Environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors</h4>
							<p>The expectation of the Trustees is that the companies selected for investment and
								managers of the funds appointed by CCLA and Sarasin will exclude those with poor ESG
								ratings, allowing for engagement with fund managers to improve ESG ratings. The
								Charity’s Investment Committee will periodically discuss and review the ESG ratings with
								CCLA and Sarasin as part of their monitoring role. </p>
							<p>The Trustees have requested CCLA and Sarasin to be proactive on their behalf by
								encouraging the companies selected for investment and managers of the funds appointed by
								them to engage on issues that are aligned with their impact goals, focusing on ESG
								factors and exercising their voting rights on the Charity’s behalf to encourage better
								corporate governance. CCLA and Sarasin will continue reporting, monitoring and
								challenging the company and fund managers on their ESG performance.</p>
